Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: simulation time for a million would be lower

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 100000 because it is still below a second
