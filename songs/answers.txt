If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
ANSWER:
Their audio aura would likely be very upbeat and high in energy.

SELECT AVG(energy) FROM songs;
+-------------+
| AVG(energy) |
+-------------+
| 0.65906     |
+-------------+
SELECT AVG(valence) FROM songs;
+--------------+
| AVG(valence) |
+--------------+
| 0.484443     |
+--------------+
SELECT AVG(danceability) FROM songs;
+-------------------+
| AVG(danceability) |
+-------------------+
| 0.71646           |
+-------------------+


Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

this might not be very representative of the listener because it doest not take into account the times the listener just randomly plays their music.
We can improve this by also taking into account the time where the listener actively listens to a song or the times where he skips or forward the songs.
