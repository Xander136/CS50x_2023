If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
ANSWER:
Their audio aura would likely be very upbeat and high in energy.

SELECT AVG(energy) FROM songs;
+-------------+
| AVG(energy) |
+-------------+
| 0.65906     |
+-------------+
SELECT AVG(valence) FROM songs;
+--------------+
| AVG(valence) |
+--------------+
| 0.484443     |
+--------------+
SELECT AVG(danceability) FROM songs;
+-------------------+
| AVG(danceability) |
+-------------------+
| 0.71646           |
+-------------------+


Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
